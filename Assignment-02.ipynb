    "## Batch Size (batch-size.png)\n",
    "The graph shows a downward trend in validation accuracy as the batch size increases. This could be due to the fact that larger batch sizes provide a more accurate estimate of the gradient, but smaller batches may offer a regularizing effect and more frequent updates, which can lead to better generalization. A smaller batch size also means the model is updated more frequently, which can lead to faster learning but also increased noise in the gradient estimation.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Learning Rate (learning-rate.png)\n",
    "In this graph, the validation accuracy improves significantly as the learning rate increases from 0.01 to 0.05, then stabilizes and starts to decrease after 0.1. This suggests that a learning rate that is too low may not traverse the loss landscape efficiently, while a learning rate that is too high might overshoot optimal points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: There's an optimal range of learning rates where the model learns efficiently without overshooting or getting stuck in local minima. Beyond this range, the learning either becomes inefficient (too low) or too erratic (too high).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number of Hidden Layers (num-hidden-layers.png)\n",
    "The trend in this graph is less straightforward, showing a peak in accuracy at 4 hidden layers, followed by a dip at 6 layers, and then an increase at 8 layers. This could indicate that the model complexity appropriate for the given task is achieved at around 4 hidden layers, but further increases may lead to overfitting, which is possibly mitigated when the number of layers is increased to 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: The model complexity needed to capture the patterns in the data is met at a certain number of layers, beyond which the model might overfit. The subsequent increase in accuracy with more layers might be due to the model's ability to capture more abstract representations.\n",
